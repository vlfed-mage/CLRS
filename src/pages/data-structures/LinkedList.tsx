          'A Linked List is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes. Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored in contiguous memory locations. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion operations. Linked lists are fundamental in computer science, used in implementing stacks, queues, graphs, and memory management systems.',
