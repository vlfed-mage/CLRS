          'Bubble Sort is one of the simplest sorting algorithms. It works by repeatedly stepping through the list, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements "bubble" to the top of the list (beginning of the array) with each iteration.',

          'Simple to understand and implement',
