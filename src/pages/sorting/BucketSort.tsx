          'Bucket Sort is a distribution-based sorting algorithm that works by distributing elements into a number of buckets, sorting each bucket individually (typically using insertion sort), and then concatenating the sorted buckets. It assumes that the input is drawn from a uniform distribution and works best when the elements are uniformly distributed across the range. The algorithm divides the input range into n equal-sized buckets, distributes elements into these buckets based on their values, sorts each bucket separately, and finally combines all buckets to produce the sorted output. Bucket Sort is particularly efficient when the input is uniformly distributed and can achieve linear average-case time complexity O(n + k) where k is the number of buckets.',
